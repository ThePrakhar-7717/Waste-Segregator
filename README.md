Introduction

• Conceptualize a project focused on waste segregation, incorporating Arduino technology at its core.

• Utilize sensors and a servo motor for real-time sorting.

• Promote hands-on learning in electronics and automation.

• Encourage student engagement with sophisticated technology.

• Foster problem-solving and environmental awareness.

Components

• Arduino Uno or Nano

• Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)

• Rain sensor

• Servo Motor (MG90S)

• Jumper Wires

• Divided waste box with flipper mechanism

Working

1. Trash Identification: The Ultrasonic sensor discerns trash presence within a defined range.

2. Moisture Evaluation: The Rain sensor determines the moisture content of the detected trash.

3. Segregation Automation: The Servo Motor automatically directs trash into appropriate compartments based on moisture evaluation.

Setup

1- Connect the components as per the schematic.

2- Upload the given Arduino code to the Arduino Uno.

3- Ensure the hardware setup includes a divided box for wet and dry waste, with a Servo Motor for automated segregation. 

Usage

1- Power on the Arduino Uno.

2- Place trash on the rain sensor to initiate the segregation process.

3- Observe the Servo Motor's movement as it slides the trash
